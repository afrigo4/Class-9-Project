I have been offered an opportunity to interview and work for a company in Chicago, Illinois. I am very excited and I want to use this opportunity to practice my learnings in Coursera in order to be prepared for the area and for possible interview questions. The key question is : How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place similar to mine now in the suburbs? Certainly, I can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply the tools from the program. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Chicago, IL, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Chicago must meet the following demands:\n\n1. Apartment must be 2 or 3 bedrooms.\n2. Desired location is near a Metra Station within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) radius.\n3. Price of rent not exceed $3,000 per month.\n4. Top ammenities in the selected neighborhood would be cafes, entertainment centers, international restaurants, and grocery stores. \n5. Desirable to have venues such as cafes, restaurants, liquor stores, gyms, and grocery stores."
